#Spoiled Veggies

This is a simple blog app that uses a RESTFUL API structure with a total of 7 routes. 

##Running Tests:

There are a total of seven tests for the routes. The tests are to ensure the correct
endpoints are reached. 

You need to run "NPM Test" in order to initiate.

##Built with:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- EJS - template engine
- Node.js - for backend processes
- Express - Web framework

##Deployment
I'm hosting this on Heroku. I have Heroku set to watch the master branch for the latest
push and travis to test endpoints. Once tests pass with travis, the app deploys.
